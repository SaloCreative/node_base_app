# Node Starter App

This project is to serve as a simple node starter application with login, registration and user menangement routes. All requests will be protected with JWT authentication and have granular permissioning. Hopefully this will provide all the necessary functionality for a base layer of an applications API

## Setup

clone the project and run

```
$ yarn install
```

## Development

Currently there is only a simple development environment which is started by running:

```
$ npm run start
```

## Build & Deployment

No build process yet setup

## API Endpoints

As there will be quite a few endpoints we have split them down into their own files so they can easily moved to a hosted API documentation solution at a later stage. A current list of all endpoints can be found in [API_ENDPOINTS.md](./API_ENDPOINTS.md)

## Changelog

As far as possible this projects changelog should be kept up to date for all releases to production. This should include bug fixing and feature releases. When a major version of the project is released a version branch will be made to keep a updatable version of historic code for bug fixes only. e.g. `v1.x.x` when moving to `v2.0.0`. The full changelog can be found in the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)
